A fanfiction site scraper for sites that don't have a download option.

Currently, this supports fanfiction.net, fictionhunt.net, portkey.org, and spacebattles forums. With
minor changes, it can support any BB forum.

Features:
* Convert to arbitrary ebook format (azw3, epub, mobi, HTML, you name it)
* Convert quotes to curly quotes, double dashes to &mdash;,	etc
* Convert a series into a single ebook

Examples:

    ./ffnet.py


Requirements:
* Python3
* BeautifulSoup 4
* Calibre

I've only tested this on Linux.
